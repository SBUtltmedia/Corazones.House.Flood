IMPORT SETTTINGS:

	I find the import settings that work best are: 

	- Load Type: Decompress On Load
	- Preload Audio Data: Off
	- Compression Format: Vorbis
	- Quality: 50 (probably doesn't matter, but I couldn't hear any audible difference setting this lower)
	- Sample Rate Settings: Optimize Sample Rate
